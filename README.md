# Car-Dealership-Log-In-Andorid-Application
This is my Mobile Car Dealership Application.
Used a navigation drawer with spinners in order to show the user the selections they can choose from.
This is one project from my Mobile Application Design Class at California State University. (CECS 453)

Navigation Drawer:

Spinner on the Left determines the values on the spinner on the Right.
Spinner on the Left is Car Maker.
Spinner on the Right Shows which models from those Maker are available at the dealership.
Dealership Data is Gathered from a JSON object.

Main Screen:
Display text shows, price of the car, features of the car, price point, Date the Car came to inventory, and a picture of the car.

Login/Sign up:
No database, all local storage using Maps to store user information, username, password, email, and phonenumber.
Input validation for signing up a new user checks if theres an exisitng user with that username, if passwords match, if email entered is in an Email Format, and if Number is Numeric and Follows Global Telephone number.
